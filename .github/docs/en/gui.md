# Web GUI

**🌍 Language / Lingua:** [🇬🇧 English](gui.md) | [🇮🇹 Italiano](../../docs/it/gui.md)

<- [Back to main README](../../../README.md)

A web-based interface built with Django for searching and downloading content directly from your browser.

![Home](../img/gui/home.png)

## Quick Start

```bash
pip install -r GUI/requirements.txt
python GUI/manage.py migrate
python GUI/manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
```

Then open `http://<host>:8000` in a browser. For Docker/NAS deployments see the main README
and the [NAS deployment guide](nas.md) instead of running the dev server directly.

## Features

### Search & download

- **Home** (`/`) — pick a site and search for a title.
- **Results** (`/search/`) — each result can be downloaded, added to the watchlist, or (for
  series) expanded to show seasons and episodes via the series-detail view.
- **Start download** (`/download/`) — queues the selected movie or episodes. Track selection
  (video/audio/subtitle) follows the same `config.json` filters as the CLI.

### Downloads dashboard

`/downloads/` shows the live download queue and history:

- Live status and progress polled from `api/get-downloads/`.
- **Stop** a running download (`api/kill-download/`).
- **Stop and clear the queue** (`api/kill-and-clear-queue/`).
- **Clear history** of completed/failed entries (`api/clear-history/`).

> For some providers the progress bar may stay at 0% even though the download is running —
> see *Known Issues* in the main README.

### Watchlist & auto-download

`/watchlist/` tracks series (and movies) and can download new content automatically:

- **Add** a title from the search results, or **remove** individual items / **clear** the
  whole list. Metadata (seasons, poster, TMDB id) is fetched in the background so the UI stays
  responsive.
- **Update all** re-checks every item on demand.
- **Per-item auto-download** toggle (`watchlist/auto/<id>`): for a series you enable it on a
  specific season; VibraVid then downloads newly published episodes of that season
  automatically.
- **Run now** (`watchlist/auto-run/`) triggers an immediate check instead of waiting for the
  next cycle.
- **Polling interval** (`watchlist/auto-interval/`) — how often the auto-loop checks for new
  episodes. Default is **4 hours** (14400 s); selectable values are 5 min, 15 min, 30 min,
  1 h, 6 h, 12 h, and 24 h. The interval can also be set with the
  `WATCHLIST_AUTO_INTERVAL_SECONDS` environment variable.

### Settings / configuration editor

`/settings/` is an in-browser editor for `Conf/config.json` and `Conf/login.json`:

- Edits both files in tabs, validates JSON before saving, and writes a `.backup` alongside
  the original.
- `ARR.max_concurrent_downloads` is applied live without a restart. Most other settings take
  effect after a **reload** (`api/reload-config/`, which reloads config and/or login through
  the config manager) or a restart of the server.

### Custom service upload

Upload a custom site module as a ZIP (`api/upload-service/`); it is extracted into
`VibraVid/services/` and the registry is reloaded (`api/registry-status/`). This complements
the `imp_service` config key. An uploaded service only appears in the GUI site dropdown if it
ships a matching stub at `GUI/searchapp/api/<service_name>.py`.

### In-app update

When a newer release is available the UI shows an update banner. The version check
(`api/version/check/`) is cached for one hour; the update action (`api/version/update/`)
applies it in place. For Docker one-click updates (Docker socket requirement) see the main
README.

### ARR stack page

`/arr-stack/` is a status and control panel for the Seerr/Sonarr/Radarr integration: it lists
VibraVid's internal ARR processing queue (filterable by status/source/sync) and can trigger a
sync (`api/arr/trigger-sync/`). Webhook endpoints and full configuration are documented in the
[ARR section of the main README](../../../README.md#arr-integration).

## CSRF & Reverse Proxy

When accessing the GUI from outside the local network or behind a reverse proxy, Django may reject requests due to CSRF validation failures. Configure the following environment variables as needed.

### Trusted Origins

Required when requests arrive from a domain or port not matching Django's expected origin:

```
CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS="http://127.0.0.1:8000 https://yourdomain.com"
```

### HTTPS Forwarding

If the reverse proxy terminates SSL/TLS, forward the scheme to Django:

**Apache:**
```apache
RequestHeader set X-Forwarded-Proto "https"
```

**Environment variable:**
```
SECURE_PROXY_SSL_HEADER_ENABLED=true
```

### Recommended Variables for Proxy Deployments

```
ALLOWED_HOSTS="yourdomain.com"
USE_X_FORWARDED_HOST=true
CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE=true
SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=true
```
